# short url

> A simple URL shortener by [Christopher Jaeger](https://github.com/moglerdev)


## What is this?

This is a simple URL shortener. It is written in JavaScript and uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/).
As a database it uses [Redis](https://redis.io/).

## How to use it?

### Prerequisites

I prefer to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run this application. If you don't have it installed, you can find the installation instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
As a package manager I use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). You can install it with the following command:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Running the application

#### Run Redis

```bash
docker run --name short-url-redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis
```

#### Run the application

```bash
pnpm install

pnpm start
```
